# High Issues

## H-1: `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

	```

</details>



## H-2: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

	    uint256 private s_tokenCounter;
	```

</details>



## H-3: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

	```solidity
	    function withdrawFees() external {
	```

</details>



## H-4: Dangerous strict equality checks on contract balances.

A contract's balance can be forcibly manipulated by another selfdestructing contract. Therefore, it's recommended to use >, <, >= or <= instead of strict equality.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 163](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L163)

	```solidity
	        require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
	```

</details>



## H-5: Weak Randomness

The use of keccak256 hash functions on predictable values like block.timestamp, block.number, or similar data, including modulo operations on these values, should be avoided for generating randomness, as they are easily predictable and manipulable. The `PREVRANDAO` opcode also should not be used as a source of randomness. Instead, utilize Chainlink VRF for cryptographically secure and provably random values to ensure protocol integrity.

	```

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 18](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L18)

	```solidity
	contract PuppyRaffle is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 172](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L172)

	```solidity
	    function changeFeeAddress(address newFeeAddress) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

</details>



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

	```solidity
	        feeAddress = newFeeAddress;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

	```solidity
	        uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
	```

</details>



## L-6: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event FeeAddressChanged(address newFeeAddress);
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-8: Loop contains `require`/`revert` statements

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop
